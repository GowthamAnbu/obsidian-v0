Let’s troubleshoot and set up your Windows 10 Home server so you can access it from your MacBook M3 Pro again. Since it worked before, we’ll focus on retracing the steps to ensure network discovery, file sharing, and accessibility are properly configured. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get it working:

### Step 1: Verify Network Connectivity
1. **Check the IP Address**: You mentioned your Windows 10 device is on `192.168.1.202`. On your Windows machine:
   - Open Command Prompt (type `cmd` in the Start menu) and run `ipconfig`. Confirm the IPv4 address is still `192.168.1.202`. If it’s changed, note the new IP.
2. **Ping from MacBook**: On your MacBook, open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and type:
   ```
   ping 192.168.1.202
   ```
   - If you get a response (e.g., "64 bytes from..."), the devices can see each other on the network. If not, there’s a connectivity issue (firewall, network settings, or router).

### Step 2: Enable File Sharing and Network Discovery on Windows 10
Since you’ve previously tweaked firewall, registry, and group policy settings, let’s ensure the essentials are still active:
1. **Network and Sharing Settings**:
   - Go to `Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Advanced sharing settings`.
   - Under **Private** (assuming your network is set to Private):
     - Turn on **Network discovery**.
     - Turn on **File and printer sharing**.
   - Under **All Networks**:
     - Enable **Public folder sharing** (optional, if you’re using it).
     - Turn off **Password-protected sharing** (for easier access, unless you need security—then set up credentials later).
   - Save changes.

2. **Windows Firewall**:
   - Open `Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Allowed apps`.
   - Ensure **File and Printer Sharing** is checked for both Private and Public networks.
   - If it’s not listed, click **Allow another app**, browse to `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`, and manually allow it.

3. **Services Check**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and hit Enter.
   - Ensure these services are running (right-click > Start if they’re not):
     - **Function Discovery Provider Host**
     - **Function Discovery Resource Publication**
     - **Server**
     - **Workstation**
     - **TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper**

### Step 3: Share a Folder or Drive
1. **Set Up Sharing**:
   - Right-click the folder or drive you want to access (e.g., `D:\SharedFolder`).
   - Select `Properties > Sharing tab > Share`.
   - Add **Everyone** or a specific user (e.g., your Windows account) and set permissions to **Read/Write**.
   - Click `Share`, then note the network path (e.g., `\\192.168.1.202\SharedFolder`).

2. **Advanced Sharing** (if needed):
   - In the same `Sharing` tab, click **Advanced Sharing**.
   - Check **Share this folder**, adjust permissions, and apply.

### Step 4: Access from MacBook
1. **Connect to Server**:
   - On your MacBook, open Finder.
   - Press `Command + K` (or Go > Connect to Server).
   - Enter: `smb://192.168.1.202` (SMB is the protocol Windows uses for file sharing).
   - Click **Connect**.

2. **Login Credentials**:
   - If prompted, use your Windows 10 username and password. If you turned off password-protected sharing, it should connect without credentials.
   - If you’re unsure, try `Guest` with no password, or create a specific user on Windows (`Control Panel > User Accounts`) and use those credentials.

3. **Mount the Share**:
   - Once connected, you’ll see the shared folders. Drag them to your sidebar in Finder for quick access.

### Step 5: Troubleshooting
If it still doesn’t work:
- **Firewall Check**: Temporarily disable the Windows Firewall (`Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off`) to test. If it works, re-enable it and adjust rules (e.g., allow SMB port 445 inbound/outbound).
- **IP Conflict**: Ensure `192.168.1.202` is static or reserved in your router settings to avoid DHCP changes.
- **Network Type**: Confirm your Windows network is set to **Private** (not Public) in `Network and Sharing Center`.
- **Mac Firewall**: On your Mac, go to `System Settings > Network > Firewall` and ensure it’s not blocking connections.
- **Restart Both Devices**: A reboot can resolve temporary glitches.

### Step 6: Optional Registry/Group Policy Recap
Since you mentioned past changes:
- **Registry**: If you edited `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer`, ensure `DependOnService` includes `SamSS` and `Srv`. Avoid reverting unless necessary.
- **Group Policy**: If you used `gpedit.msc`, check `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options`—ensure **Network access: Let Everyone permissions apply** is enabled.

Try these steps, and let me know where it fails or what error you get. We’ll tweak it from there!
