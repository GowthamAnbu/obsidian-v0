Let’s troubleshoot and set up your Windows 10 Home server so you can access it from your MacBook M3 Pro again. Since it worked before, we’ll focus on retracing the steps to ensure network discovery, file sharing, and accessibility are properly configured. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get it working:

### Step 1: Verify Network Connectivity
1. **Check the IP Address**: You mentioned your Windows 10 device is on `192.168.1.202`. On your Windows machine:
   - Open Command Prompt (type `cmd` in the Start menu) and run `ipconfig`. Confirm the IPv4 address is still `192.168.1.202`. If it’s changed, note the new IP.
2. **Ping from MacBook**: On your MacBook, open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and type:
   ```
   ping 192.168.1.202
   ```
   - If you get a response (e.g., "64 bytes from..."), the devices can see each other on the network. If not, there’s a connectivity issue (firewall, network settings, or router).

### Step 2: Enable File Sharing and Network Discovery on Windows 10
Since you’ve previously tweaked firewall, registry, and group policy settings, let’s ensure the essentials are still active:
1. **Network and Sharing Settings**:
   - Go to `Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Advanced sharing settings`.
   - Under **Private** (assuming your network is set to Private):
     - Turn on **Network discovery**.
     - Turn on **File and printer sharing**.
   - Under **All Networks**:
     - Enable **Public folder sharing** (optional, if you’re using it).
     - Turn off **Password-protected sharing** (for easier access, unless you need security—then set up credentials later).
   - Save changes.

2. **Windows Firewall**:
   - Open `Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Allowed apps`.
   - Ensure **File and Printer Sharing** is checked for both Private and Public networks.
   - If it’s not listed, click **Allow another app**, browse to `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`, and manually allow it.

3. **Services Check**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and hit Enter.
   - Ensure these services are running (right-click > Start if they’re not):
     - **Function Discovery Provider Host**
     - **Function Discovery Resource Publication**
     - **Server**
     - **Workstation**
     - **TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper**

### Step 3: Share a Folder or Drive
1. **Set Up Sharing**:
   - Right-click the folder or drive you want to access (e.g., `D:\SharedFolder`).
   - Select `Properties > Sharing tab > Share`.
   - Add **Everyone** or a specific user (e.g., your Windows account) and set permissions to **Read/Write**.
   - Click `Share`, then note the network path (e.g., `\\192.168.1.202\SharedFolder`).

2. **Advanced Sharing** (if needed):
   - In the same `Sharing` tab, click **Advanced Sharing**.
   - Check **Share this folder**, adjust permissions, and apply.

### Step 4: Access from MacBook
1. **Connect to Server**:
   - On your MacBook, open Finder.
   - Press `Command + K` (or Go > Connect to Server).
   - Enter: `smb://192.168.1.202` (SMB is the protocol Windows uses for file sharing).
   - Click **Connect**.

2. **Login Credentials**:
   - If prompted, use your Windows 10 username and password. If you turned off password-protected sharing, it should connect without credentials.
   - If you’re unsure, try `Guest` with no password, or create a specific user on Windows (`Control Panel > User Accounts`) and use those credentials.

3. **Mount the Share**:
   - Once connected, you’ll see the shared folders. Drag them to your sidebar in Finder for quick access.

### Step 5: Troubleshooting
If it still doesn’t work:
- **Firewall Check**: Temporarily disable the Windows Firewall (`Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off`) to test. If it works, re-enable it and adjust rules (e.g., allow SMB port 445 inbound/outbound).
- **IP Conflict**: Ensure `192.168.1.202` is static or reserved in your router settings to avoid DHCP changes.
- **Network Type**: Confirm your Windows network is set to **Private** (not Public) in `Network and Sharing Center`.
- **Mac Firewall**: On your Mac, go to `System Settings > Network > Firewall` and ensure it’s not blocking connections.
- **Restart Both Devices**: A reboot can resolve temporary glitches.

### Step 6: Optional Registry/Group Policy Recap
Since you mentioned past changes:
- **Registry**: If you edited `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer`, ensure `DependOnService` includes `SamSS` and `Srv`. Avoid reverting unless necessary.
- **Group Policy**: If you used `gpedit.msc`, check `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options`—ensure **Network access: Let Everyone permissions apply** is enabled.

Try these steps, and let me know where it fails or what error you get. We’ll tweak it from there!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I assume by "Windows app" you mean the **Remote Desktop** app (like Microsoft Remote Desktop) on your MacBook M3 Pro, which you previously used to access not just files but the full graphical user interface (GUI) of your Windows 10 Home server. Since file sharing via Finder (SMB) is working, the network connectivity is solid, but Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) requires additional setup on Windows 10 Home because it’s not natively supported like in Pro editions. Let’s get the GUI access working by enabling RDP or an alternative solution.

### Why It’s Not Working
Windows 10 **Home** doesn’t include the built-in Remote Desktop Server feature (only Pro and above do). If it worked before, you likely used a workaround (e.g., third-party tools or registry hacks) that might have been undone by updates or misconfiguration. Let’s explore your options and set it up again.

---

### Option 1: Enable RDP on Windows 10 Home (Workaround)
Since Windows 10 Home doesn’t officially support RDP hosting, you might have used a tool like **RDP Wrapper Library** in the past. Here’s how to set it up:

1. **Download RDP Wrapper**:
   - Go to the RDP Wrapper GitHub page (search for "RDP Wrapper Library" online) and download the latest release (e.g., `rdpwrap.zip`).
   - Extract it to a folder on your Windows 10 machine (e.g., `C:\RDPWrap`).

2. **Install RDP Wrapper**:
   - Run `install.bat` as Administrator (right-click > Run as Administrator).
   - Then run `update.bat` to ensure it’s up to date.
   - Open `RDPConf.exe` (in the same folder) to check the status. It should say "Fully supported" or "Listener state: Listening [not supported]"—the latter is fine with the wrapper.

3. **Enable Remote Desktop**:
   - Go to `Settings > System > Remote Desktop`.
   - Normally, this is grayed out on Home, but RDP Wrapper bypasses that. If it’s still inaccessible, proceed anyway.

4. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Open `Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings > Inbound Rules`.
   - Create a new rule:
     - Type: Port
     - Protocol: TCP
     - Specific Ports: 3389 (default RDP port)
     - Allow the connection
     - Apply to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
     - Name it "RDP Port 3389"
   - Repeat for **Outbound Rules**.

5. **Test from MacBook**:
   - Open **Microsoft Remote Desktop** (download it from the Mac App Store if you don’t have it).
   - Add a new PC:
     - PC name: `192.168.1.202`
     - User account: Your Windows username and password (or leave blank if no password).
   - Connect. If it works, you’ll see the Windows GUI.

**Note**: Windows updates can break RDP Wrapper. If it fails, re-run `update.bat` or reinstall it.

---

### Option 2: Use a Third-Party Alternative (Easier)
If RDP Wrapper feels cumbersome or doesn’t work, use a tool like **VNC** or **TeamViewer** for GUI access:

#### VNC Setup
1. **Install VNC Server on Windows**:
   - Download **TightVNC** or **UltraVNC** (free and lightweight) from their official sites.
   - Install it on your Windows 10 machine.
   - Set a strong password during setup (you’ll need it to connect).

2. **Firewall Adjustment**:
   - Allow VNC through the firewall:
     - TCP port 5900 (default for VNC).
     - Follow the same steps as above in Windows Firewall > Inbound Rules.

3. **Install VNC Viewer on MacBook**:
   - Download **VNC Viewer** by RealVNC (available for macOS) from their site or the App Store.
   - Open it, enter `192.168.1.202:5900`, and input the password you set.

4. **Connect**:
   - You’ll get the full Windows GUI. VNC is simpler than RDP for Home editions and works reliably.

#### TeamViewer Setup (Simplest)
1. **Install TeamViewer**:
   - Download TeamViewer (free for personal use) on both your Windows 10 machine and MacBook from teamviewer.com.
   - On Windows, set it to run as a service (unattended access) during setup.

2. **Connect**:
   - Note the TeamViewer ID on your Windows machine.
   - On your MacBook, open TeamViewer, enter the ID, and connect with the password shown on the Windows side.
   - You’ll see the GUI instantly.

---

### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting
If you try RDP Wrapper and it still doesn’t work:
- **Check RDP Service**: Open `services.msc` and ensure **Remote Desktop Services** is running (RDP Wrapper should handle this).
- **Port 3389**: On your MacBook Terminal, run `telnet 192.168.1.202 3389`. If it connects (blank screen), the port is open. If not, revisit the firewall.
- **Credentials**: Ensure your Windows account has a password (RDP often requires it). Go to `Control Panel > User Accounts` to set one if needed.

If you used something other than RDP before (e.g., VNC), let me know, and I’ll refine the steps!

---

### What Worked Before?
Since you said it worked previously, can you recall if you used Microsoft Remote Desktop, VNC, or another tool? If it was RDP, RDP Wrapper is likely what you tweaked in the registry or firewall. If unsure, I recommend **TeamViewer** for simplicity or **VNC** for a lightweight solution.

Try one of these, and tell me how it goes or what errors pop up—I’ll guide you further!

----------------------------------------------------


Since you’re using **RDP Wrapper** and `RDPConf.exe` shows the **Listener state** as "Not Listening" and "Not supported," it means the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) listener isn’t active or properly configured on your Windows 10 Home machine. This is a common issue with RDP Wrapper, especially after Windows updates or misconfigurations. Let’s fix it step-by-step so you can use it again *right now* to access the GUI from your MacBook M3 Pro.

---

### Step 1: Diagnose and Fix the Listener State
The "Not Listening" status typically means the RDP Wrapper service isn’t running, the configuration file is outdated, or a Windows update has interfered. Here’s how to resolve it:

1. **Check RDP Wrapper Installation**:
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted RDP Wrapper (e.g., `C:\RDPWrap`).
   - Ensure you have these files: `RDPWInst.exe`, `rdpwrap.ini`, `RDPConf.exe`, and `RDPCheck.exe`.

2. **Update RDP Wrapper**:
   - Windows updates might have changed the RDP version, making the old `rdpwrap.ini` incompatible.
   - Open a web browser on your Windows machine, go to the RDP Wrapper GitHub page (search "RDP Wrapper Library"), and check the "Issues" or "Releases" section for the latest `rdpwrap.ini` file.
   - Download the updated `rdpwrap.ini` and replace the one in your RDP Wrapper folder (e.g., `C:\RDPWrap`).

3. **Reinstall RDP Wrapper**:
   - Right-click `RDPWInst.exe` and select **Run as Administrator**.
   - Uninstall first: Run `RDPWInst.exe -u` in Command Prompt (open CMD as Admin, navigate to the folder with `cd C:\RDPWrap`, then type the command).
   - Install again: Run `RDPWInst.exe -i`.
   - This refreshes the service and applies the updated `.ini` file.

4. **Start the RDP Service**:
   - Open `services.msc` (Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, Enter).
   - Find **Remote Desktop Services (TermService)**.
   - Right-click it, select **Restart** (or **Start** if it’s stopped).
   - If it won’t start, proceed to the next step and return here.

5. **Check Listener State**:
   - Open `RDPConf.exe` again.
   - If it now says "Listening [not supported]" or "Fully supported," you’re good. "Not supported" is fine with RDP Wrapper—it just means Windows doesn’t natively support it, but the wrapper is handling it.

---

### Step 2: Ensure Firewall and Ports Are Open
The listener won’t work if the RDP port (3389) is blocked.

1. **Firewall Rule**:
   - Open `Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings > Inbound Rules`.
   - Look for a rule named "RDP Port 3389" (or similar). If it’s there, ensure it’s enabled.
   - If not, create it:
     - New Rule > Port > TCP > Specific Ports: 3389 > Allow the connection > Apply to all profiles > Name it "RDP Port 3389".
   - Do the same for **Outbound Rules**.

2. **Test Port 3389**:
   - On your Windows machine, open Command Prompt and run:
     ```
     netstat -an | find "3389"
     ```
     - If you see `TCP 0.0.0.0:3389 LISTENING`, the port is open and listening. If not, the service or firewall is still blocking it.

---

### Step 3: Final Configuration Checks
1. **Enable Remote Desktop**:
   - Go to `Settings > System > Remote Desktop` on Windows 10.
   - Even on Home, RDP Wrapper should make this clickable. Toggle it **On** if possible (it might not be, which is okay).

2. **Set a Password**:
   - RDP often requires a password-protected account. Go to `Control Panel > User Accounts > Manage Accounts`, select your user, and set a password if it doesn’t have one.

3. **Restart the Machine**:
   - Reboot your Windows 10 device to ensure all changes take effect.

---

### Step 4: Connect from Your MacBook NOW
1. **Open Microsoft Remote Desktop**:
   - Launch the **Microsoft Remote Desktop** app on your MacBook M3 Pro (download from the Mac App Store if needed).

2. **Add the PC**:
   - Click the `+` button > Add PC.
   - **PC name**: `192.168.1.202`
   - **User account**: Enter your Windows username and password (e.g., `Username: YourName`, `Password: YourPassword`). Or select "Ask when required" if unsure.
   - Save it.

3. **Connect**:
   - Double-click the new entry (192.168.1.202).
   - If it prompts about a certificate, accept it (this is normal for self-hosted RDP).

4. **Success**:
   - You should see your Windows 10 GUI. If it connects, you’re done!

---

### If It Still Says "Not Listening" or Won’t Connect
- **Run RDPCheck.exe**: In the RDP Wrapper folder, run `RDPCheck.exe` to test locally. If it fails, the wrapper isn’t hooking properly.
- **Windows Version**: Open `winver` (type it in the Start menu search). If it’s a very recent build (e.g., 22H2 or later), the `rdpwrap.ini` might not support it yet—check GitHub for a matching version.
- **Fallback Test**: Temporarily disable the Windows Firewall (`Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Turn off`) and try again. If it works, re-enable and adjust the rules.

---

### Make It Work NOW
After following these steps, your listener should be active (showing "Listening" in `RDPConf.exe`), and you’ll connect from your MacBook. If you hit a snag—like an outdated `.ini` or a firewall block—tell me the exact error or status in `RDPConf.exe`, and I’ll tweak it further. Assuming the latest `rdpwrap.ini` matches your Windows build, you’ll be up and running in 10-15 minutes. Go for it, and let me know how it turns out!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you’re not seeing the `rdpwrap.ini` file in either your existing RDP Wrapper folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\RDP Wrapper`) or the newly downloaded zip from the RDP Wrapper GitHub page, don’t worry—it’s a common hiccup, especially with how releases are handled. Let’s sort this out so you can get that listener state to "Listening" and connect from your MacBook M3 Pro.

### Why the .ini File Might Be Missing
- **Old Installation**: Your existing folder might predate when `rdpwrap.ini` updates were managed separately, or it could’ve been deleted/corrupted.
- **GitHub Release**: The official RDP Wrapper releases (like v1.6.2) often don’t bundle the latest `rdpwrap.ini` in the zip because it’s maintained dynamically by the community to match evolving Windows builds. The zip typically includes `RDPWInst.exe`, `RDPConf.exe`, etc., but not always the `.ini`.
- **Manual Update Required**: Since Windows 10 Home’s `termsrv.dll` changes with updates, the `.ini` file needs to be sourced separately to support your specific build.

### Step 1: Locate or Obtain the rdpwrap.ini File
Here’s how to get it:

1. **Check Your Existing Folder**:
   - Open `C:\Program Files\RDP Wrapper` (or wherever you installed it).
   - Look for `rdpwrap.ini`. If it’s not there, proceed to fetch it.

2. **Download from GitHub**:
   - Visit the RDP Wrapper GitHub page: `github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap`.
   - Go to the **Releases** section and download the latest zip (e.g., `RDPWrap-v1.6.2.zip`).
   - Extract it. If `rdpwrap.ini` isn’t in there (sometimes it’s outdated or missing), don’t panic—move to the next step.

3. **Get the Latest rdpwrap.ini from Community Sources**:
   - The most up-to-date `rdpwrap.ini` is often in the **Issues** section or community forks because it’s updated to match new `termsrv.dll` versions.
   - Go to `github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues` or check forks like `github.com/sebaxakerhtc/rdpwrap.ini`.
   - Look for a recent `rdpwrap.ini` file. For example:
     - Direct link (as of recent community updates): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebaxakerhtc/rdpwrap.ini/master/rdpwrap.ini`.
     - Right-click the "Raw" button, select "Save Link As," and save it as `rdpwrap.ini`.
   - Alternatively, copy the text from that page into a new file:
     - Open Notepad, paste the content, and save it as `rdpwrap.ini` (ensure it’s not `rdpwrap.ini.txt`—turn off "Hide extensions for known file types" in File Explorer options if needed).

4. **Place the File**:
   - Move the downloaded or created `rdpwrap.ini` to `C:\Program Files\RDP Wrapper`. If prompted, overwrite any existing (likely outdated) version.

---

### Step 2: Verify and Update RDP Wrapper
Now that you have the `.ini`, let’s ensure it works:

1. **Run RDPWInst to Reinstall**:
   - In your RDP Wrapper folder (or the extracted zip), right-click `RDPWInst.exe` > **Run as Administrator**.
   - Uninstall first: `RDPWInst.exe -u` (open Command Prompt as Admin, navigate with `cd C:\Program Files\RDP Wrapper`, then run).
   - Install again: `RDPWInst.exe -i`. This uses the new `rdpwrap.ini`.

2. **Check Listener State**:
   - Open `RDPConf.exe` (Run as Administrator).
   - If it says "Listening [not supported]" or "Fully supported," you’re set. If still "Not Listening," the `.ini` might not match your Windows build.

3. **Match Your Windows Build**:
   - Run `winver` (type in Start menu) to see your version (e.g., 22H2, Build 19045.XXXX).
   - Open `rdpwrap.ini` in Notepad and search (`Ctrl + F`) for your build number (e.g., `10.0.19045`). If it’s missing, the `.ini` doesn’t support your version yet—grab a newer one from the Issues section or a fork matching your build.

---

### Step 3: Force the Listener to Start
If it’s still "Not Listening":

1. **Restart Remote Desktop Service**:
   - Open `services.msc` (Win + R, type it, Enter).
   - Find **Remote Desktop Services (TermService)**, right-click > **Restart**.

2. **Test Locally**:
   - Run `RDPCheck.exe` from the RDP Wrapper folder. If a local RDP session opens, the listener is working but might be blocked externally.

3. **Firewall Check**:
   - Ensure port 3389 is open:
     - `Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings > Inbound Rules`.
     - Add or enable a rule for TCP 3389 (as described earlier).

---

### Step 4: Connect from MacBook
- Open **Microsoft Remote Desktop** on your MacBook.
- Add PC: `192.168.1.202`, use your Windows username/password.
- Connect. If it works, you’re golden!

---

### If the .ini Still Doesn’t Work
If `RDPConf.exe` still shows "Not Listening" or "Not supported":
- **Post on GitHub**: In the Issues section of `stascorp/rdpwrap`, report your `termsrv.dll` version (find it in `C:\Windows\System32`, right-click > Properties > Details) and ask for an updated `.ini`.
- **Temporary Workaround**: Use VNC or TeamViewer (as outlined earlier) until the `.ini` is updated.

You should have the `.ini` now and, with luck, a working RDP setup. Let me know what `RDPConf.exe` shows after this, and I’ll fine-tune it further if needed!



---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since your Windows 10 version is **23H2**, we need to ensure RDP Wrapper works with this specific build (e.g., something like Build 19045.XXXX—the exact number after "19045" matters). The "Not Listening" issue in `RDPConf.exe` often stems from an outdated or incompatible `rdpwrap.ini` file that doesn’t support the `termsrv.dll` version in 23H2. Let’s get this fixed so you can connect from your MacBook M3 Pro right away.

---

### Step 1: Confirm Your Exact Build and termsrv.dll Version
1. **Check Build Number**:
   - Run `winver` again (type it in Start menu search) and note the full build, e.g., "Version 23H2 (Build 19045.3803)"—the number after 19045 is key.
   - Tell me the exact build (e.g., 19045.3803) if it’s not too much trouble, so I can pinpoint the right fix.

2. **Check termsrv.dll Version**:
   - Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32`.
   - Find `termsrv.dll`, right-click > **Properties** > **Details** tab.
   - Note the "File version" (e.g., 10.0.19041.3636 or something close). This helps match the `.ini`.

---

### Step 2: Get the Right rdpwrap.ini for 23H2
The official RDP Wrapper release (v1.6.2) and its default `.ini` often lag behind newer Windows builds like 23H2. Community updates are our solution.

1. **Source the Latest rdpwrap.ini**:
   - Go to `github.com/sebaxakerhtc/rdpwrap.ini` or `github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/issues`.
   - Look for a recent `rdpwrap.ini` supporting 23H2 (search for "23H2" or "19045" in the Issues or file content).
   - Example direct link: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebaxakerhtc/rdpwrap.ini/master/rdpwrap.ini`.
   - Download it (right-click "Raw" > Save Link As > `rdpwrap.ini`) or copy the text into Notepad and save as `rdpwrap.ini` in your RDP Wrapper folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\RDP Wrapper`).

2. **Verify Build Support**:
   - Open the downloaded `rdpwrap.ini` in Notepad.
   - Search (`Ctrl + F`) for your build, e.g., `[10.0.19045.3803]` (replace 3803 with your exact number).
   - If it’s there, you’re set. If not, we’ll tweak it manually (see Step 4 if needed).

---

### Step 3: Reinstall RDP Wrapper with the New .ini
1. **Uninstall Old Version**:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator (Start > type `cmd` > right-click > Run as Admin).
   - Navigate to your RDP Wrapper folder: `cd C:\Program Files\RDP Wrapper`.
   - Run: `RDPWInst.exe -u`.

2. **Install with New .ini**:
   - Copy the new `rdpwrap.ini` into the folder.
   - Run: `RDPWInst.exe -i`.
   - This hooks the updated `.ini` to your 23H2 `termsrv.dll`.

3. **Restart Services**:
   - Open `services.msc` (Win + R > type it > Enter).
   - Find **Remote Desktop Services (TermService)**, right-click > **Restart**.

4. **Check Listener**:
   - Run `RDPConf.exe` (as Administrator).
   - If it says "Listening [not supported]" or "Fully supported," you’re good. If still "Not Listening," proceed further.

---

### Step 4: Force Listener to Work (if Still Not Listening)
If the `.ini` doesn’t match perfectly or the listener still won’t start:

1. **Manually Edit rdpwrap.ini** (if build is missing)**:
   - Open `rdpwrap.ini` in Notepad.
   - Add a section for your build at the bottom, e.g.:
     ```
     [10.0.19045.3803]
     LocalPort=3389
     ```
     (Replace 3803 with your exact build number.)
   - Save it, then reinstall with `RDPWInst.exe -i`.

2. **Check DLL Compatibility**:
   - If the listener still fails, the `termsrv.dll` version might need a specific offset tweak in the `.ini`. Share your `termsrv.dll` file version (from Step 1), and I’ll help craft a precise entry.

3. **Firewall Double-Check**:
   - Ensure TCP 3389 is open:
     - `Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings > Inbound Rules`.
     - Rule: TCP, Port 3389, Allow, All profiles.

4. **Test Locally**:
   - Run `RDPCheck.exe`. If it opens a local RDP session, the listener is active but might be blocked externally.

---

### Step 5: Connect from MacBook
1. **Microsoft Remote Desktop**:
   - On your MacBook, open the app.
   - Add PC: `192.168.1.202`.
   - Username: Your Windows username (e.g., "YourName").
   - Password: Your Windows password (set one in `Control Panel > User Accounts` if blank).
   - Save and connect.

2. **Verify**:
   - If it connects and you see the GUI, success! If it fails (e.g., "Can’t connect"), note the error.

---

### Troubleshooting 23H2-Specific Issues
- **Windows Updates**: 23H2 might have patched `termsrv.dll` beyond what older `.ini` files expect. If the above `.ini` doesn’t work, search GitHub Issues for "23H2" or "19045" to find a user-posted `.ini` that matches.
- **Fallback**: If RDP Wrapper proves stubborn, install **TightVNC** or **TeamViewer** as a quick GUI solution (I can walk you through that too).

Run these steps, and let me know what `RDPConf.exe` shows after reinstalling with the new `.ini`. If it’s still "Not Listening," share your exact build (e.g., 19045.3803) and `termsrv.dll` version—I’ll dig deeper to make it work NOW!
