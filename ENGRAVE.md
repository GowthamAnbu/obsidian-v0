1. THE MORE INNER I LOOK INTO - THE MORE AWARE I BECOME OF MYSELF AND THE UNIVERSES - what the fuck is this. I think this is Quantum Coherence and Quantum entanglement. LOCAL AND NON-LOCAL OUR HUMAN UNDERSTANDING. AWARENESS Is currently non comprehensive to me. pursue this. 
2. we truly become what we do. so fuckin' do it.
3. THE MORE MATERIALIST SUPER CREATION THING I BUY I AM ABLE TO DO UNLOCK MORE POTENTIAL - it is NOT materialist view. it's not only craftmanship but also fuckin able to do things like macbook + obsidian + git helped me with my state, thought, emotions, feelings, understanding.
4. A very simple act of pushing a friend led to me awakening my potential. so don't be afraid to push others. They either open or close that's all there is. and we are not so weak that we develop this gap by pursuing our goals. FUCK THAT mentality of ONLY pushing others. JUMP IN. DIVE DEEP and then PULL THEM UP. we are TOO STRONG so we infact PUSH them and PUSH ourselves and then push THEM so hard they FALL and then DIVE DEEP INTO THE OCEAN and PULL them or PUSH THEM SO SO HARD They DIVE DEEP and then come out of the ocean the other way - this is the best - because they not only coming out themselves but the PURSUIT/path is entirely different than what the PUSHER took.
