THE MORE INNER I LOOK INTO - THE MORE AWARE I BECOME OF MYSELF AND THE UNIVERSES - what the fuck is this. I think this is Quantum Coherence and Quantum entanglement. LOCAL AND NON-LOCAL OUR HUMAN UNDERSTANDING. AWARENESS Is currently non comprehensive to me. pursue this. ENGRAVE

we truly become what we do. so fuckin' do it - DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS ENGRAVE

hey confrontation vs integrity is the path to be and to be is the path to not to be. 
pursuit both to be and not to be. Not to be is what you gonna when you age eventually so always pursuit to be now and then ocassialy timebox 'To be' and try to be 'NOT BE'. These words may seem confusing but read it again and again to engrave the true meaning FUTURE me ü´µüèª



Technology is very very useful - eg. Obsidian, Git. Choosing obsidian is the best option because I can edit notes in github for non desktop places very quicky and to get the whole picture of graphs and represntation things I can use obsidian in desktop/laptop etc... 



Obsidian is the reason i was able to preserve my thoughts and emotions and ultimately clicked for my disturbing masturbation problem.


TED Talk (covalent bond high school science behind dandruff) again technology like YouTube enabled it.

TICK TICK and obsidian are a great creation of craftsmanship at its best.

THE MORE MATERIALIST SUPER CREATION THING I BUY I AM ABLE TO DO UNLOCK MORE POTENTIAL - it is NOT materialist view. it's not only craftmanship but also fuckin able to do things like macbook + obsidian + git helped me with my state, thought, emotions, feelings, understanding. ENGRAVE (you will be conflicting this in the FUTURE ü´µüèª)

SO don't think tech is all bad. Create your own hardware and software da TECHIE 


A very simple act of pushing a friend led to me awakening my potential. so don't be afraid to push others. They either open or close that's all there is. and we are not so weak that we develop this gap by pursuing our goals. FUCK THAT mentality of ONLY pushing others. JUMP IN. DIVE DEEP and then PULL THEM UP.
we are TOO STRONG so we infact PUSH them and PUSH ourselves and then push THEM so hard they FALL and then DIVE DEEP INTO THE OCEAN and PULL them or PUSH THEM SO SO HARD They DIVE DEEP and then come out of the ocean the other way - this is the best - because they not only coming out themselves but the PURSUIT/path is entirely different than what the PUSHER took. Bharry ‚ù§Ô∏è is a best example here. will try this with RISHWAN IDIOT. ENGRAVE


ignorance (others) do help a lot atleast professionally ü§£.I wouldn't say I am manipulating them or anything. it feels like me capitalising that ignorance not knowingly but the way people think they are all mighty and good and to see them feel that mghitinesss like they acomplised something and I kinda like it I am not saying I would enjoy that because it is false and it doesn't improve them but it's a weried feeling I don't have never experienced this feeling before and It's not that I like it. it's just a new experience and it's freshness is good that's all I think I like the freshness of it not the feeling itself (profoundness in the freshness feeling of it. I have become more aware of the freshness of it and not letting muself think it's the soakness of that 'like' feeeling- I am starting to get the gist of the awareness too well by separting feeling/emotions from the thought process or understanding or realizatoin of things LOL (LOL is PROFOUND)) (LOL FUTURE ENGRAVE).. meaning I am not leaving out information (some consider leaving out info as not lying but I think that it's cheating).




Boxing is also extreme thing so you have to do Naddhi Sudhi daily and gradually transcend to meditation. This is because of the ZERO of infinity possibly and eventually becoming the Infiniity with Zeros


Itachi uchiha and standing up for greater good even at the cost of not only us, ours, me, myself, my dad, mom etc... but alao other. even though I know nothing matters in the larger schem of things and everything matter internally to me. you have to STAND UP. ENGRAVE FUTURE QUICKIE



I started thinking in terms of Irony to everything or rather I would say I am more aware of all the irony of things around,within,to,from universe. both the inner and outer of me,myslef,aroundme,outer or inner universe. There were lot of moments(I mean plenty in the last week alone) where I felt the irony of things. The last time  I felt irony is while thinking about what learning this universe is teaching my physical life to improve my spiritual being. While pondering Learning I realized DAMN the learning part does make my life easy. It has a very very powerful whole meaning to it.That's the irony I mentioned above also. The learning part of my more awareness being meant that taking challenges as opportunties as people say is has much much more meaning. It is the irony of opposite things. Like my thought of learning Eg.enakunu vanthu vachiruku paru (true meaning here is when people generally mean their kids - but in a good way)opposite to this is thinking thiruvilaiyadal of god on your life is a both learning(both positive and negative) to you as well as learning(both positive and negative) to others. Postive (positive for others, negative for you so neutal as whole ? what the fuck da? thoughts have layers and these onion layers are irony to each other and us discovering this is LOL 14-12-20245:25AM) - making an example out of you by beating the shit out of you.negative(negative to you, positive to others, again neutral ?) - making you make the shit out of others (during this whole thought I came to the realization that IRONY is 3 6 9). I thought me thinking that beating the shit of santh guy is a thinking out of angry (was angry because of the bad attitudes of TL guy at work) but I also felt that It can't be simply angry when I was recording this during my bike ride back home. and all these led to here. shit ! awareness is truly powerful LOL.
in the every day life if we do difficult thing I mean the real difficult thing Our life becomes easy. I meant easy/difficult as way of life or the fulfilling physical or spiritual life - not feeling,emotions,happy,sad etc... those are shit. The irony of life in itself is Irony of the not understanding (incomprehensive (instead of using YET) (i didn't use NONComprehensive also (NON Comprehesive is not comprehesive to human understaning itself, incomprehensive is not included every aspect of the thing))). even though Me realising all this is bat's shit for the "greater grand things".



IRONY - 3 6 9 - IRONY is the cycle 3 6 9 - QUICKIE LOL. Maybe already I know this deep down (unconcious). this knowing becomes realization. like taking this gut feeling or some knowledge feeling (you know something is behind here) from deep down and surface it is realization.


concious is realization | unconcious is gut feeling or intitution ? QUICKIE










mischieve (spitting on your face, monkey bum move MAGIZHAN MAPILLAI) and kids - disrespect is NOT - QUICKIE
