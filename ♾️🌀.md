pursuit both to be and not to be. Not to be is what you gonna when you age eventually so always pursuit to be now and then ocassialy timebox 'To be' and try to be 'NOT BE'. These words may seem confusing but read it again and again to engrave the true meaning future me ü´µüèª



Technology is very very useful - eg. Obsidian, Git. Choosing obsidian is the best option because I can edit notes in github for non desktop places very quicky and to get the whole picture of graphs and represntation things I can use obsidian in desktop/laptop etc... 



Obsidian is the reason i was able to preserve my thoughts and emotions and ultimately clicked for my disturbing masturbation problem.


TED Talk (covalent bond high school science behind dandruff) again technology like YouTube enabled it.

TICK TICK and obsidian are a great creation of craftsmanship at its best.


SO don't think tech is all bad. Create your own hardware and software da TECHIE
