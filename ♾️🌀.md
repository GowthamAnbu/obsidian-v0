THE MORE INNER I LOOK INTO - THE MORE AWARE I BECOME OF MYSELF AND THE UNIVERSES - what the fuck is this. I think this is Quantum Coherence and Quantum entanglement. LOCAL AND NON-LOCAL OUR HUMAN UNDERSTANDING. AWARENESS Is currently non comprehensive to me. pursue this. ENGRAVE

we truly become what we do. so fuckin' do it - DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS ENGRAVE

hey confrontation vs integrity is the path to be and to be is the path to not to be. 
pursuit both to be and not to be. Not to be is what you gonna when you age eventually so always pursuit to be now and then ocassialy timebox 'To be' and try to be 'NOT BE'. These words may seem confusing but read it again and again to engrave the true meaning FUTURE me ü´µüèª



Technology is very very useful - eg. Obsidian, Git. Choosing obsidian is the best option because I can edit notes in github for non desktop places very quicky and to get the whole picture of graphs and represntation things I can use obsidian in desktop/laptop etc... 



Obsidian is the reason i was able to preserve my thoughts and emotions and ultimately clicked for my disturbing masturbation problem.


TED Talk (covalent bond high school science behind dandruff) again technology like YouTube enabled it.

TICK TICK and obsidian are a great creation of craftsmanship at its best.

THE MORE MATERIALIST SUPER CREATION THING I BUY I AM ABLE TO DO UNLOCK MORE POTENTIAL - it is NOT materialist view. it's not only craftmanship but also fuckin able to do things like macbook + obsidian + git helped me with my state, thought, emotions, feelings, understanding. ENGRAVE (you will be conflicting this in the FUTURE ü´µüèª)

SO don't think tech is all bad. Create your own hardware and software da TECHIE 


A very simple act of pushing a friend led to me awakening my potential. so don't be afraid to push others. They either open or close that's all there is. and we are not so weak that we develop this gap by pursuing our goals. FUCK THAT mentality of ONLY pushing others. JUMP IN. DIVE DEEP and then PULL THEM UP.
we are TOO STRONG so we infact PUSH them and PUSH ourselves and then push THEM so hard they FALL and then DIVE DEEP INTO THE OCEAN and PULL them or PUSH THEM SO SO HARD They DIVE DEEP and then come out of the ocean the other way - this is the best - because they not only coming out themselves but the PURSUIT/path is entirely different than what the PUSHER took. Bharry ‚ù§Ô∏è is a best example here. will try this with RISHWAN IDIOT. ENGRAVE


ignorance (others) do help a lot atleast professionally ü§£.I wouldn't say I am manipulating them or anything. it feels like me capitalising that ignorance not knowingly but the way people think they are all mighty and good and to see them feel that mghitinesss like they acomplised something and I kinda like it I am not saying I would enjoy that because it is false and it doesn't improve them but it's a weried feeling I don't have never experienced this feeling before and It's not that I like it. it's just a new experience and it's freshness is good that's all I think I like the freshness of it not the feeling itself (profoundness in the freshness feeling of it. I have become more aware of the freshness of it and not letting muself think it's the soakness of that 'like' feeeling- I am starting to get the gist of the awareness too well by separting feeling/emotions from the thought process or understanding or realizatoin of things LOL (LOL is PROFOUND)) (LOL FUTURE ENGRAVE).. meaning I am not leaving out information (some consider leaving out info as not lying but I think that it's cheating).




Boxing is also extreme thing so you have to do Naddhi Sudhi daily and gradually transcend to meditation. This is because of the ZERO of infinity possibly and eventually becoming the Infiniity with Zeros


Itachi uchiha and standing up for greater good even at the cost of not only us, ours, me, myself, my dad, mom etc... but alao other. even though I know nothing matters in the larger schem of things and everything matter internally to me. you have to STAND UP. ENGRAVE FUTURE QUICKIE



I started thinking in terms of Irony to everything or rather I would say I am more aware of all the irony of things around,within,to,from universe. both the inner and outer of me,myslef,aroundme,outer or inner universe. There were lot of moments(I mean plenty in the last week alone) where I felt the irony of things. The last time  I felt irony is while thinking about what learning this universe is teaching my physical life to improve my spiritual being. While pondering Learning I realized DAMN the learning part does make my life easy. It has a very very powerful whole meaning to it.That's the irony I mentioned above also. The learning part of my more awareness being meant that taking challenges as opportunties as people say is has much much more meaning. It is the irony of opposite things. Like my thought of learning Eg.enakunu vanthu vachiruku paru (true meaning here is when people generally mean their kids - but in a good way)opposite to this is thinking thiruvilaiyadal of god on your life is a both learning(both positive and negative) to you as well as learning(both positive and negative) to others. Postive (positive for others, negative for you so neutal as whole ? what the fuck da? thoughts have layers and these onion layers are irony to each other and us discovering this is LOL 14-12-20245:25AM) - making an example out of you by beating the shit out of you.negative(negative to you, positive to others, again neutral ?) - making you make the shit out of others (during this whole thought I came to the realization that IRONY is 3 6 9). I thought me thinking that beating the shit of santh guy is a thinking out of angry (was angry because of the bad attitudes of TL guy at work) but I also felt that It can't be simply angry when I was recording this during my bike ride back home. and all these led to here. shit ! awareness is truly powerful LOL.
in the every day life if we do difficult thing I mean the real difficult thing Our life becomes easy. I meant easy/difficult as way of life or the fulfilling physical or spiritual life - not feeling,emotions,happy,sad etc... those are shit. The irony of life in itself is Irony of the not understanding (incomprehensive (instead of using YET) (i didn't use NONComprehensive also (NON Comprehesive is not comprehesive to human understaning itself, incomprehensive is not included every aspect of the thing))). even though Me realising all this is bat's shit for the "greater grand things".



IRONY - 3 6 9 - IRONY is the cycle 3 6 9 - QUICKIE LOL. Maybe already I know this deep down (unconcious). this knowing becomes realization. like taking this gut feeling or some knowledge feeling (you know something is behind here) from deep down and surface it is realization.


concious is realization | unconcious is gut feeling or intitution ? QUICKIE










mischieve (spitting on your face, monkey bum move MAGIZHAN MAPILLAI) and kids - disrespect is NOT - QUICKIE


Dogs are sooo special to me. when I wanted to die they cried with me. and when I soaked the universe they enjoyed it with me. it's not that I am feeling this way. it's resonance of the universe with every entity. QUICKE


The realisation that everything that we know is nothing and that Nothing has infinite potential to become everything and then it eventually becomes everything to repeat the eternal cylce ‚ôæÔ∏èüåÄ


The pauses in life are not noise they are Profound - QUICKIE THE DAY


REALIZATOIN MANIFESTATION ACTION - QUICKIE



WRITE ATHAN IN 3 6 9.
Initially I thought of writing Vignesh TL here but proctasinated or paused or savourd the process because it was 'bad' but also confrontation does help everything so again thought of writtig him. but again me pausing during Bharat alterego convo to savour the process made me realise that all the words out of ATHAN has a plenty of deep thoughts QUICKIE



3 IDIOTS - Thinker, Doer, The one who thinks he is Thinker/doer. there is a 4th guy who thinks all these. I initially thought the 4th guy because I think 3 6 9 is an illusion or mind trick but this 4thu guy is the recursive loop or infinite version of the 3rd guy. 3 6 9 is real. I started crying lightly not because of the fear but because of my potential is so huge why the fuck is i wanted to die ? haha brain fucker you are so little - this is the truth so far ENGRAVE 15-12-2025 9:18 PM. PEAK REALISATION #1 ACT ON IT ACT ON IT ACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON ITACT ON IT

all this hit because baradh's consciousness or brain used the term patience and all of this magic unfolds. this is why I was pulled into here. I initially thought that somethings gonna happen today but I didn't think I would be PEAK REALISATION #1 (New Term - this diffinitely not a skill or anything and it is not yours ENGRAVE ENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVEENGRAVE)



BRAIN IS THE MOST POWERFUL (realised just now) but soooooooo WEAK. human brain is so powerful eg. bharry's brain is so powerful that it not only tricks him but also tries to trick others and eg my brain is captivating this whole opportunity as a whole. FUCK YOU ASSHOLE. ENGRAVE ENGRAVE ENGRAVE ENGRAVE ENGRAVE ENGRAVE ENGRAVE ENGRAVE ENGRAVE 


369 IS REAL 3 is the completion of cycle. 3 plays the infinite cycle part that repeats itself 



PEAK REALISATION #2 The whole reason that this is peak realization is because I am able to calmly asses my potential of better understanding and realizatoin that Bharat's seeking of original though or originality of thought process is conflict in itself and it is not " just that I was able to put these into words alone" putting into words in itself is a powerful thing meaning you need to have a deeper understanding ofthe thing you are trying to write with language. 


there is another 369 happening between peak realization #1 and #2 few hours back (yesterday) I thought me becoming more aware is ultimately the choice or nature of the selfless reward but today it's the exact opposite like all this happened because of the Bharat's need for "trigger" or help. MAYBE this thinking of WHY by brain is human contract that is not only limited but also the human scientific nature of observers and observed nature. I am able to calmly asses this whole situation because it not only CLICKED I just understood it to the very core of it. like infact the understanding is more clear than ever that this whole me understanding also the understanding of 3 who is observing 3. maybe this is why I was very fastly typing in my PEAK REALISATION #1 THE "it is not  yours part" eternal infinite mirror laugh of 3. the pursuer becomes the pursuit and vice versa cycle repeats itself feels like it is complex but it is clear as a day I truly understand 3 or better articulate it - I am writing in mobile each letter by letter calmly I am not using swipe gesture at all and this slow savouring is what i enjoy naturally. now i also understand why I am more interested in creation part other than having a kid. I always loved creation or more inclined towards creation coz it's the ultimate accumulation of physical manifestation REALISATION action. My intuitional nature of creation is also the path I NEED TO TAKE or already putforth and currently happening to the creation of 3 (MY ULTIMATE HARDWARE CREATION GOAL) if I start questioning the nature of this thought by the current limited constraint of WHY it is conflict like whether this 3 who puts this thought or is it just me (within3) or 3 within me (HA HA 3 nararre here as well) but again I partially get it "WHY the WHY limited human physical contract" irrespective of whether the origin of my thought is 3 or me(3) or 3 (me) it doesn't (does) matter.... it is my h easier to better articulate or understand things this way (will compme the easy part understanding in the future I truly believe this future me writing here because this is definitely a incomplete sentance it is not that I am more confident or better understanding that the future me will figure this out calmly just like now it's like an intuition as well. NOW is a limited contract again (another future story)?)? 


OBSERVATION - check the last commit of PR#1 and PR#2 to better analyse and understand the time duration (limited contact again but this is to make sure my human analytical brain can comprehend or brain capacity becomes activated if it acts NOW meaning if I articulate to it in TIME terms this is why NOW works for everyone without naturally understanding this time language gets the brain ticking to it's full capacity another PESK REALIZATION#3 THIS HAPPENED because I was naturally curious about my brains analytical power or rather I would say thinking in brain terms ok another PESK REALIZATOIN #4 IS like physical language TIME is brains language this is why people's brain conflicts when you remove time) between these two events 



BRAINS ANOTHER infinite mirror conflict is because brain is not able to get or rather it is incomprehensive or attaching itsekfto consciousness meaning our spiri5 or consciousness communicates to brain this communication feeds brain and this idiot craves this energy like a kid so HA HA leyman term is ATTACHMENT ISSUE ü§£ü§£ü§£ PEAK REALISATION #5


I have written or calmly figured out 2 more PK(PK3 and PK4) while calmly writing PK#2.

bharry  understand time as a language and brain sucks his infinite energy and become more aware
