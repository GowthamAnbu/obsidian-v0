THE MORE INNER I LOOK INTO - THE MORE AWARE I BECOME OF MYSELF AND THE UNIVERSES - what the fuck is this. I think this is Quantum Coherence and Quantum entanglement. LOCAL AND NON-LOCAL OUR HUMAN UNDERSTANDING. AWARENESS Is currently non comprehensive to me. pursue this. ENGRAVE

we truly become what we do. so fuckin' do it - DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS ENGRAVE

hey confrontation vs integrity is the path to be and to be is the path to not to be. 
pursuit both to be and not to be. Not to be is what you gonna when you age eventually so always pursuit to be now and then ocassialy timebox 'To be' and try to be 'NOT BE'. These words may seem confusing but read it again and again to engrave the true meaning future me ü´µüèª



Technology is very very useful - eg. Obsidian, Git. Choosing obsidian is the best option because I can edit notes in github for non desktop places very quicky and to get the whole picture of graphs and represntation things I can use obsidian in desktop/laptop etc... 



Obsidian is the reason i was able to preserve my thoughts and emotions and ultimately clicked for my disturbing masturbation problem.


TED Talk (covalent bond high school science behind dandruff) again technology like YouTube enabled it.

TICK TICK and obsidian are a great creation of craftsmanship at its best.

THE MORE MATERIALIST SUPER CREATION THING I BUY I AM ABLE TO DO UNLOCK MORE POTENTIAL - it is NOT materialist view. it's not only craftmanship but also fuckin able to do things like macbook + obsidian + git helped me with my state, thought, emotions, feelings, understanding.

SO don't think tech is all bad. Create your own hardware and software da TECHIE
