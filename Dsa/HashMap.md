My Summary:

POJO javascript doesn't have uniqueness to it coz it converts keys into strings.
We can only truly create maps in javascript by only using C++ (v8 engine).

**What is a Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO)?**

A **Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO)** is a regular JavaScript object that is not tied to any prototype chain (like Map, Set, or Date). It’s just a simple {} object with key-value pairs.

  

Example of a POJO:

```
const obj = { foo: 42, bar: "hello" };
```

This object:

• Has **no special behavior**.

• Uses **simple key-value pairs**.

• Doesn’t inherit from Map, Set, or any specialized data structure.

**What is ThePrimeagen Trying to Say?**

  

When he says you **can’t create an actual Map in JavaScript** using just a POJO, he means that **all keys in a plain object are just strings**.

  

**Example of the Problem:**

```
const obj = {};
obj[1] = "one";
obj["1"] = "another one";

console.log(obj); // { '1': 'another one' }
```

• JavaScript **automatically converts number keys to strings** (1 → "1").

• This means { foo: "value", bar: "value" } and { "foo": "value", "bar": "value" } are indistinguishable.

---

**The Core First Principle: Identity and Uniqueness**

  

**Key Idea:**

**In JavaScript, a plain object ({}) cannot distinguish between different data types for keys. All keys are automatically converted to strings.**

  

A **Map**, on the other hand, can **distinguish keys by identity**:

```
const map = new Map();
map.set(1, "one");
map.set("1", "another one");

console.log(map); 
// Map(2) { 1 => 'one', '1' => 'another one' } ✅
```

• Here, 1 and "1" are treated as **different keys**.

• Unlike a POJO, Map allows **non-string keys** like objects, arrays, or numbers.

  

**How Does This Relate to First Principles?**

  

ThePrimeagen is likely applying **the principle of identity & uniqueness in data structures**:

1. **Objects as POJOs** → Good for simple key-value storage but lack key identity.

2. **Maps as Key-Value Stores** → Maintain **true uniqueness** by using **object references**.

  

**First Principles Breakdown:**

• **POJOs are not true maps** → because they **lose identity** by converting keys to strings.

• **True maps (like Map) preserve identity** → since they can differentiate objects, numbers, and strings.

• **Choosing the right tool for the job** → Use Map for complex key-value lookups, not {}.

---

**Why Does This Matter?**

  

If you’re using POJOs as dictionaries, you’re **implicitly assuming** that keys will always be strings, which is a **leaky abstraction**. If you truly want **object identity-based key storage**, you should use Map.

  

**Example of POJO Failing Identity Checks**

```
const obj = {};
const key1 = {};
const key2 = {};

obj[key1] = "value1";
obj[key2] = "value2";

console.log(obj); // { '[object Object]': 'value2' } ❌
```

• The POJO **converted both objects into the string "[object Object]"**, so key2 overwrote key1.

  

**Example of Map Handling Identity Correctly**

```
const map = new Map();
const key1 = {};
const key2 = {};

map.set(key1, "value1");
map.set(key2, "value2");

console.log(map); 
// Map(2) { {} => 'value1', {} => 'value2' } ✅
```

• Map **preserves unique object keys**.

---

**Summary**

• **POJOs ({}) fail to distinguish keys by identity** because all keys are coerced into strings.

• **Maps (new Map()) preserve uniqueness** and allow objects as keys.

• **First Principle** → **Identity matters in data structures**; don’t assume {} behaves like a true map.

---

🔥 **TL;DR:**

If you need a **true key-value store with identity**, use Map.

If you just need a simple dictionary with string keys, use {}.
