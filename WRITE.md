Hi Vishnu,

Your Implementation is CRISP. It does what exactly need to be done. Early Returns design pattern you used is the pinnacle usage of this pattern. I have seen developer communities having conflicting usage for this pattern. But you NAILED it. It passed all sonar cube checks perfectly.

I know we discussed the conflicting nature of the branches with superset and subset leakages and I advised you to reverse engineer it and start with the end result to the flow. And you did implement it exactly the same.

You didn't have no thought while implementing it, I would rather say that the focused single thought of closing the task is a fruition. At first glance your implementation seems like a direct approach of reverse engineering. But its hidden beauty is in the early returns abstracting away the branches from our cognition. This is the whole logic behind it passing the cognition complexity check Appreciate your extra mile of working till & PM yesterday. You creating this beautifully crisp implementation is why I do what I do professionally. It's for these moments we do the extra mile. SOAKin this moment for you to enjoy it again in your professional journey.

Thanks and Regards,
Gowtham A.
