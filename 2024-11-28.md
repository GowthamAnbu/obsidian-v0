Hey Team, This is my new alt account I have created very recently to explore Technical Side of all things. My original account is @Gowtham_Anbu5. I am from Chennai, TamilNadu, India. I have been meaning to create a new account for a quite a lot of time and this is me going for it to explore all the Technical creators of the platform to have a better feed with all things technical. The main reason for creating this new account, instead of using my current account @Gowtham_Anbu5, is for posting a lot of technical things and possibly one day grow into a big organic account and to have a feed for consuming technical content alone. 
I am challenging myself by 'learning by doing things' and by forcing myself into creating a new account for posting all my creations, I am making myself more accountable to doing actionable items.I use my original account almost every day for consuming all content. But my old account is like a Frankenstein of all things.
I wanna be able to separate my techie into his own account that doesn't mean I am gonna stop following my tech creators in my original account - it's quite the opposite - my original account @Gowtham_Anbu5 is gonna be the superset for my new account @0x2250.

Core Idea for creating a new account:
1. For posting all my technical creations.
2. To consume technical content alone.
3. Grow account so much so that this is possible only with a clean state of having its own new account.
4. and I do like my original account for consuming all content and I enjoy doing so forever even with my new alt account.
5. The naming 0x2250 is like a memory address kind of thing - I wanna create my own hardware with its own OS one day. ("If your dream is not big enough to be worth risking your life for, then it's not worth chasing." - Blackbeard (Marshall D. Teach) | One Piece)



All these years I thought of myself to be a dumb freak just to realize I am a perfectly alright average being is a Freakin' Enlightenment. Sure hope I am not the only one. 

average being - meant that everyone can experience and think all this - it's just that they are just curious on other things. Special has become so changed into this something that not everyone can be. (All) Ackushually (pun intended) Average Alright Being is special too - and it doesn't belong in the sense of someone or something special - it's just that everyone is special and at the same time no one is just like quantum entanglement. 
Sure hope I am not the only one. - I meant you experiencing similar self discovery. I am editing this to update your memory that your response felt like you suggesting me things that can help me with the inferiority - I thought you would get that I meant "You here" and not people(don't limit your scope here). so next time you do know that I am not someone that needs help like that ðŸ˜‚. and be more open and thoughtful of my messages with hidden meanings and try to do your own self discovery.
