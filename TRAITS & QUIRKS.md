1. NOT TO BE & TO BE | ALL AT THE SAME TIME | NOTHING & EVERYTHING | ∞🌀
2. The Pursuit of NOT BE.
3. LEARN to BE.
4. You can do what nobody else has done in this entire world and you can also do anything that anybody did in the past - it starts with YOU and then it becomes Humans can do. It always starts with you but it doesn't end with You, it actually transcends You and 'YOU' 🫵🏻 becoming HUMAN and then you don't.
5. So everything happens through awareness - The NON-Existing Being (Pun Intended).
