hey confrontation vs integrity is the path to be and to be is the path to not to be. 
pursuit both to be and not to be. Not to be is what you gonna when you age eventually so always pursuit to be now and then ocassialy timebox 'To be' and try to be 'NOT BE'. These words may seem confusing but read it again and again to engrave the true meaning future me 🫵🏻
