deep dive into why I watched porn yesterday. 
not procrastination of talking to anyone like Chithappa - I postponed it due to the climate mood and the energy swing both internal and external (why did inthink Chithappa call - not particularl to the incidents happening now but this is due to in the past I was open but not this open I didn't speak much to anyone or rather I would say no confrontation if my intrusive thoughts and emotions).
I watched it mainly because I had more testastrone and like the idiotic brains defensive mechanism for evolution of the species it spewed the chemicals (vanmTha kakitiy√® da pavi brain).
so boxing is gonna regulate my testastrone to next level regulate in the sense channeling the energy to focused productive hours and ultimately increasing my stamina and endurance of not only to boring stuff but also to exciting stuff (deep dive into this excitement controller or rather time box emotions coz we need emotions to do anything and timebox thoughts for better docus both are equally important).okay I am typing this standing in my workplace coz all my superiors or in Mumbai and I am drenched in rain 12/12/2024 1:18pm.
