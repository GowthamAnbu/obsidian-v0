	1. Mirror Version cyclic knowing/understanding/realizing Paradox  or what it the correct name for it ?:
		1. we start with knowing/understanding/realizing something at level 0 and then at level 1 it is the exact opposite of our current level0 knowing/understanding/realizing and then at level 2 it is the exact opposite of  our current level1 knowing/understanding/realizing and then at level 3 it is the exact opposite of our current level2 knowing/understanding/realizing and so on...
	2. get the meme of the sin curve take it from primeagen where initailly there is basic understanding and at the end it is the basic understanding but with a much much deeper realizations/new understandings.
	3. how does this corelate to the first prompt above  ?
	4. At Times where we feel to control emotions and then unleash it occasionally to really learn it or go all extreme and don't even control or rather let go of the control (or the feeling of control - control in itself is an illusion ?). Both the above two things are one and the same ? the act of controlling emotions and the unleashing it meaning that control in itself is an extreme thing (coz one can feel extreme emotions and the act of controlling in itself become extreme ? and let of control or feeling of control something like the same ?) The act of controlling and the act of let of control - both are real and illusion at the same time ? -  "Go to all extremes of everything including everything to become nothing" - (yes this is my quote).
		1. "If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision, mockery, isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And you'll do it despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is." - this is an extreme thing to do to pursue one's goals or passion ?
		2. What if we Time box this extremeness - we do everything in a time boxed manner - do all extreme things but also at the same time both control it and let go of control at the same time. 
		3. I said lot things above but I don't know the name for each - so give me the names of each as well with the summary and detailed explanation of them as well (maybe links to YT videos, books where can I research further by deep diving)
		4. and if we just expand the scope from emotions to senses/ non-sense entities = then This is what Awareness is then ? 
	5.
